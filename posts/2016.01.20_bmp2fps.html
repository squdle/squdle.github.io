BMP 2 FPS
</h3>

<p>
Traditional animators used to use music with a bpm that divided well into 24 frames per second.
If you need to animate to music, you might want keyframes to hit on each beat.
This can be a bit tricky when the numbers don't divide well.

<a href="https://github.com/squdle/bpm2fps">I wrote a small python script to help with this.</a>

It's far from perfect, but can be used to get a good starting point.
